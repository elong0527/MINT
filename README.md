MicroTDC
=========

An R package for Microbial Temporal Dependency Comparison 

We also provide an ipython notebook in folder `python` to illustrate how to perform the test in python. 

## Installation ##

I assume that all auxillary packages are already installed

From an interactive R session:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("elong0527/MicroTDC")
library(MicroTDC)
```
