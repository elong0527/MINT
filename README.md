MicroTDC
=========

An R package for Mcrobial Interdependence Non-parametric Test (MINT)

We also provide an ipython notebook in folder `python` to illustrate how to perform the test in python. 

## Installation ##

I assume that all auxillary packages are already installed

From an interactive R session:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("elong0527/MINT")
library(MINT)
```
